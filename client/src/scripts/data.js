Each month is linked to a meaningful object and a challenge that raises awareness about these everyday struggles.Participants can join the challenges and share them on social media using one of two hashtags.The first is a monthly hashtag that donates €1 to the related cause while the second is a general hashtag for people who want to participate without donating directly.In that case Lotus donates €1 behind the scenes. After completing each challenge students receive a digital badge to show their participation.These badges can also be exchanged with friends creating a sense of fun motivation and community. The idea encourages both awareness and collective action in a playful way.It turns social media engagement into real support for families in need and helps students understand the hidden struggles behind education costs.The campaign targets first and second year secondary students combining empathy creativity and social impact.",

        reflection: "This was my first time creating a design in Blender, so everything felt new and challenging. I learned how to work with 3D shapes, lighting, and materials to bring my idea to life. It took some time to understand the tools, but it was exciting to see my concept slowly turn into a realistic illustration. This project gave me a good first experience with 3D design and made me curious to explore Blender even more."
